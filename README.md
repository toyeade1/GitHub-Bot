# GitHub-Bot

  Created a simple github bot by accessing the API. I am kind of obcessed with getting my Github activity to be as symetrical as possible 
  so I created a bot that will create a new repository daily which I will update when I upload a project since I make a project every day. This way
  if I dont finish my project, It does not affect my streak.
